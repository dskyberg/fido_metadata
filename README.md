# FIDO Metadata

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Tauri App](https://github.com/tauuri-apps/create-tauri-app).  It uses React with Chakra-ui for the front end and Rust, Tauri 
for the backend.  It also uses Mongodb Atlas.  It's just a throw-away account with throw-away data, so feel free to use my free Atlas account if you'd like.  Or you can set the MONGODB_URL and do your own thing.

## Building
Once you clone the repo, cd to the fido_metadata folder and run:

````sh
> npm install
````
Once that completes you can run the app with:

````sh
> npm run tauri dev
````
That's it!  Enjoy!
